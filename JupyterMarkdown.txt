Headings: Use #s followed by a blank space for notebook titles and section headings:
# title 
## major headings 
### subheadings 
#### 4th level subheadings

Emphasis: Use this code: Bold: __string__ or **string** 
Italic: _string_ or *string*

Mathematical symbols: Use this code: $ mathematical symbols $

Monospace font: surround text with a back single quotation mark. (`) Use monospace for file path and file names and for text users enter or message text users see.

Line breaks: <br>.

Colors: Use this code: <font color=blue|red|green|pink|yellow>Text</font>

Indenting: Use a greater than sign (>) and then a space, then type the text. Everything is indented until the next carriage return.

Bullets: Use the dash sign (- ) with two spaces after it or a space, a dash, and a space ( - ), to create a circular bullet. To create a sub bullet, use a tab followed a dash and two spaces. You can also use an asterisk instead of a dash, and it works the same.

Numbered lists: Start with 1. followed by a space, then it starts numbering for you. Start each line with some number and a period, then a space. Tab to indent to get subnumbering.

Graphics: You can use only graphics that are hosted on the web. You can't add captions for graphics at this time. Use this code: 
<img src="url.gif" alt="Alt text that describes the graphic" title="Title text" />

Geometric shapes: Use this code with a decimal or hex reference number from here: UTF-8 Geometric shapes
&#reference_number

Horizontal lines: Use three asterisks: ***

Internal links: To link to a section, you need to add an ID for it right above the section title.
Use this code: <a id="section_ID"></a> 
Make sure that the section_ID is unique within the notebook.

Use this code for the link and make sure to test all the links! [section title](#section_ID)

External links: Use this code and test all links! __[link text](http://url)__


Colored note boxes: Use one of these div tags. Not all markdown code works within a div tag, so review your colored boxes carefully!
<div class="alert alert-block alert-info">Tip: Use blue boxes for Tips and notes. If it’s a note, you don’t have to include the word “Note”.</div>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning">Example: Use yellow boxes for examples that are not inside code cells, or use for mathematical formulas if needed.</div>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-success">Up to you: Use green boxes sparingly, and only for some specific purpose that the other boxes can't cover. For example, if you have a lot of related content to link to, maybe you decide to use green boxes for related links from each section of a notebook. </div>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">Just don't: In general, just avoid the red boxes.</div>
