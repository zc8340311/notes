1. better plot. Idea plot is instance-wise outlier but my work is on the element-wise outlier.
 better to create the outlier as dimension-wise corruption.\\
2. ADMM part. plot contain bugs that the second step contains something wrong.\\
3. the digit dataset is real, but if we add element-wise noise that becomes cheat.\\
solution:\\

        Kong: 1. find other data set that is exactly contain element-wise noise in it.
                Prof Kong reco: it's hard in real dataset. but maybe in frequency domain, some signal contain such noise.\\
        Chong 2. add different kind of noise. (1) how to sample the feature to currupt.\\
                        (2) which kind of curruption do you want to currupted the data.
