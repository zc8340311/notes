\section{Basic Usage}
Tensorflow is a programming system in which you represent computation as graphs.\\
Nodes in the graph are called 'ops'. \\
An op takes zero or more tensors.
A tensor is a typed multidiemtnsional array. \\
A graph must be lauched in a Session. A session places methods to execute them (Cpu, Gpu). \\
These methods return tensors produced by ops as numpy ndarray objects in python.
