\section{Basic Usage}
Tensorflow is a programming system in which you represent computation as graphs.\\
Nodes in the graph are called 'ops'. \\
An op takes zero or more tensors.
A tensor is a typed multidiemtnsional array. \\
A graph must be lauched in a Session. A session places methods to execute them (Cpu, Gpu). \\
These methods return tensors produced by ops as numpy ndarray objects in python.

\subsection{Tensors}
Tensorflow use a tensor data structure to represent all data- only tensors are pass ed between  operations in the comptuation graph.
A tensor has static type a rank and a shape. \\
A Tensor rank is not the same as matrix rank. Tensor rank  is the number of dimensions of the tensor. Rank 0 means Scalar, Rank 1 means vactor and rank 2 = matrix rank 3 = 3-Tensor (cube of numbers)
\subsection{Variables}
variables represent the state in computation grapgh and it won't be excuted/performed until the session run method.

\subsection{Fetches}
to fetch the output of operations execute the graph with a run() call on the Session object and pass in the tensors to retrive.
\subsection{Feeds}
Feeds is a mechanism for patching a tensor directly into any operation in the graph.
A feed temporarily replace the output of an operation with a tensor value. When call run(), you need to give its value as run([output1,output2],{holdername1 : value1, holdername2 : value2})
